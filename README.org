* About the EsgeScanner3D
This is an an old C++, Qt & OpenCV prototype that scans a live webcam feed for vertices and export them to .xyz format (compatible with meshlab). It includes a few filters to better adapt the camera input to the edge detection algorithms like gamma and exposure, it also takes screenshots!
This program is no longer maintained and mostly used as documentation for both Qt and OpenCV back when they didn't have such outstanding literature. 

  
* Features
  - Works with all webcams
  - Real time execution
  - Includes various adjustment filters
  - Exports to .xyz
  - Takes screenshots!
